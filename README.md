I am going to use this repository as a storage where I will upload some of the most interesting programs I'll code. This is mostly a time capsule. I hope that when I will graduate and I will look back at my old codes I will be able to see my progress through time.

Roulette.py is a simple program meant to simluate a number of roulette games. I was studying probability theory at the time and I wanted a program that would showcase the law of large numbers. 

With Games.py I was trying to replicate the code from this YouTube video (https://youtu.be/YNMkADpvO4w). It was my first approach to game theory and I am generally happy with how the end result turned out.

Genetic_polynomial.py was my firt attempt at using genetic algorithms. The program finds the minimum of a given (hopefully convex) function f: (x,y) -> z. Things like division by zero are not dealt with in the code. Thanks to my professor who introduced me to an extremely interesting book titled "Essentials of metaheuristics".

Txt_elab.py was an attempt to see how Zipf's law works. One of the first texts I used was Virgil's Aeneid. Fun fact: many of the words in his work occur a multiple of six times.
