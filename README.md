I am going to use this repository as a storage where I will upload some of the most interesting programs I'll code. This is mostly a time capsule. I hope that when I will graduate and I will look back at my old codes I will be able to see my progress through time.

Roulette.py is a simple program meant to simluate a number of roulette games. I was studying probability theory at the time and I wanted a program that would plot the law of large numbers.
